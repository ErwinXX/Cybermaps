<h1 align="center"> Cybersecurity Mindmaps & Flowcharts</h1>

---

## 🔍 Overview

While navigating through various machines and challenges, I realized that visual learning helped me absorb and retain knowledge more efficiently. So I started creating **mindmaps** and **flowcharts** for every topic, tool, and command I encountered.

These maps are perfect for:
-  Quickly recalling tool usage
-  Structuring your approach to solving machines
-  Preparing for CTF competitions
-  Building a solid foundation in cybersecurity

## 📦 What's Inside

-  **Tools** & commonly used commands
-  **Cybersecurity concepts** and attack vectors
-  **Room/Machine-specific workflows** (flag paths, pivoting, enumeration, etc.)
-  Tactical mindmaps to organize & accelerate your exploitation process

## 🧭 How to Use

These mindmaps are created using the [**XMind**](https://www.xmind.net/) application.  
You can:

-  **Edit** and customize them as you grow
-  **Collapse or expand** sections as needed
-  Use them during live CTF events or study sessions

>  **Pro Tip**: Combine these maps with your own notes for maximum retention!
