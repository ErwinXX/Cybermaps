## 🔍 Overview

While navigating through various machines and challenges, I realized that visual learning helped me absorb and retain knowledge more efficiently. So I started creating **mindmaps** and **flowcharts** for every topic, tool, and command I encountered.

These maps are perfect for:
- ✅ Quickly recalling tool usage
- ✅ Structuring your approach to solving machines
- ✅ Preparing for CTF competitions
- ✅ Building a solid foundation in cybersecurity

## 📦 What's Inside

- 🔧 **Tools** & commonly used commands
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity concepts** and attack vectors
- 🗂️ **Room/Machine-specific workflows** (flag paths, pivoting, enumeration, etc.)
- 🎯 Tactical mindmaps to organize & accelerate your exploitation process

## 🧭 How to Use

These mindmaps are created using the [**XMind**](https://www.xmind.net/) application.  
You can:

- 🖊️ **Edit** and customize them as you grow
- 🔄 **Collapse or expand** sections as needed
- 📌 Use them during live CTF events or study sessions

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Combine these maps with your own notes for maximum retention!
